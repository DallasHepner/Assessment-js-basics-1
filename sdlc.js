// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the developer defines objectives, project goals, and the functions and operations of the application."
const design = "This is the third step, in which there is a detailed screen layout, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other documentation is laid out. Development begins and secure code is written"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where testing and integration bring all the pieces together in an environment."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where checks are made for errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, gaps, and then put our to the public."
const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, in which the developer continually monitors the situation, updating for any bugs or errors that are encountered by the public."
